# Prevent or Delay Diabetes 

## Abstract  

The goal of this project is to investigate the factors that are most associated with diabetic patients. This allows physicians to target patients who are most likely to be diagnosed with diabetes and recommend interventions that will prevent or delay diabetes. Interventions include blood sugar control, lifestyle changes, weight management, physical activity, and diet.

## Data Science Solution  
#### Opportunity  

According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), millions of people worldwide are living with diabetes, and in 2040, more than half a billion will have diabetes. Determining the factors that are associated with diabetes allow physicians to recommend interventions that will prevent or delay diabetes.

#### Impact Hypothesis

We hypothesize that by investigating the factors that are most associated with diabetic patients will allow physicians to target patients who are most likely to be diagnosed with diabetes and recommend interventions that will prevent or delay diabetes.

#### Solution Path

Determine the factors that are most associated with diabetes by performing data analysis on diabetic patients and visualize the findings with multiple factors, such as body mass index, blood pressure, and cholesterol. 

#### Measure of Success

Prioritize 3 factors that are most associated with diabetes.

## Data

I used the diabetes health indicators dataset from Kaggle. The target variable diabetes has 3 classes: no diabetes, prediabetes, diabetes. Since the scope of this project is diabetes, I dropped rows from the data that contain “no diabetes” and “prediabetes”.

This is the link to my [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b-Q0xCfvJscso6oaSr4-d8KaJHbQKmAaRCActu_F7Sw/edit#gid=2081386921) in which I performed data analysis and used this dataset for visualizations in Tableau. The Google Sheets also includes tabs with pivot tables.

## Tools
* Google Sheets for data cleaning and analysis
* Tableau for interactive visualizations

## Communication

My presentation slides and visualizations are in this project's repository.
